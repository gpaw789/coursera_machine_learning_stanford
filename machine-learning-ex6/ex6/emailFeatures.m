function x = emailFeatures(word_indices)
%EMAILFEATURES takes in a word_indices vector and produces a feature vector
%from the word indices
%   x = EMAILFEATURES(word_indices) takes in a word_indices vector and 
%   produces a feature vector from the word indices. 

% Total number of words in the dictionary
n = 1899;

% You need to return the following variables correctly.
x = zeros(n, 1);

% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: Fill in this function to return a feature vector for the
%               given email (word_indices). To help make it easier to 
%               process the emails, we have have already pre-processed each
%               email and converted each word in the email into an index in
%               a fixed dictionary (of 1899 words). The variable
%               word_indices contains the list of indices of the words
%               which occur in one email.
% 
%               Concretely, if an email has the text:
%
%                  The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.
%
%               Then, the word_indices vector for this text might look 
%               like:
%               
%                   60  100   33   44   10     53  60  58   5
%
%               where, we have mapped each word onto a number, for example:
%
%                   the   -- 60
%                   quick -- 100
%                   ...
%
%              (note: the above numbers are just an example and are not the
%               actual mappings).
%
%              Your task is take one such word_indices vector and construct
%              a binary feature vector that indicates whether a particular
%              word occurs in the email. That is, x(i) = 1 when word i
%              is present in the email. Concretely, if the word 'the' (say,
%              index 60) appears in the email, then x(60) = 1. The feature
%              vector should look like:
%
%              x = [ 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 ... 0 0 0 0 1 ... 0 0 0 1 0 ..];
%
%


%recall that word_indices is a vector of indices of the vocabList that occured in the email
%e.g. word_indices = [2; 6; 3; 2; 1695; 1666]

%now emailFeatures is supposed to convert the word_indices into a vector of 1899x1, each element only holds 0 or 1

%poll through the word_indices
%map the index from word_indices into the correct position in x vector

for i = 1:length(word_indices)
	%any match will set the value to 0, duplicates are uneffected
	x(word_indices(i)) = 1;
end

%the output will act as "features"
